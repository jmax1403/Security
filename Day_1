NOTES

Penetration testing Overview
    Testing a network for vulnerabilities
  
  
  Cyber Kill Chain
    Recon
        can include:
            scans, harvesting emails addresses,
    Weaponization
        Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload
    Delivery
        "Initial Access"
        Delivering weaponized bundle to the victim
    Exploitation
        Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a victim's system
    Installation
        Installing malware on the asset
    Command and control
        Command channel for remote manipulation of victim
    Actions on Objectives
    
    
    Initial Access
        What is now the most common method for gaining initial access?
            Phishing!
                Spear Phishing is phishing that targets a specific group
                
    Intro to Exploit Research
        Transition from recon to weoponization
        Leverage intel about network
    Research
        open source
        Organizational Capabilities
    Capabilities
        Mission Objectives drive requirements
            collection
            effects
        Additional functionality to fullfil req
        Communications Security (COMSEC)
    Testing
        Exploit Development occurs from vulnerability pairing
    Plan
        Procure Hardware and software
        Assign developer
        Assign a tester to develop TTPs and break it
        Document testing results
        Testing environment





    APT - Advanced Persistent Threats
    Vulnerability - POTENTIAL weaknesses to a device or technology
    THREAT - Known and usable vulnerabilities
