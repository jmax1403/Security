    Cross site scripting (XSS)
        Untrsuted code on a trusted website
        Due to misconfigured web servers
        Insertion of arbitrary code into a webpage, that executes in the browser of visitors
        Unsanitized GET, POST, and PUT methods allow JS to be placed on websites
        Using the server as a proxy. Nothing will actually be stored on the server.
        
    Refelcted XSS
        Transient, occurs in error messages or search results
        Delivered through intermediate media, such as a link in an email
        Characters that are normally illegal in URLs can be Base64 encoded
    Stored XSS
        Resides on vulnerable site
        Only requires user to visit page
        
    
    POST ../../../../../<file being accessed>
    GET  (after equals sign in URL type in the path of the file you want to open.)
    
    Command Injection
              
          upload ssh key to sever so we can ssh to it w/o creds
              linops:   ssh-keygen -t rsa
                        cat file
                 web:   find out if account on web has .ssh file
                        if not, mkdir /var/www/.ssh
                        write our key into /var/www/.ssh
              linops:   copy whole contents fo keygen
                        web: echo "<key>" >> /var/www/.ssh/authorized_keys
                        check web file
                        
                        now ssh to IP from linops (use same user you exploited with key)
