        Anti-virus
          Norton, McAffe, RKHunter, Windows Defender
          ls -latr /etc --- all configured shit, LAST RESORT, latr is ordered by recent modification, so (better than -lisa)
          ls -latr /var/log --- most recent logs at bottom
          systemctl --type=service --no-pager      to find services fro anti-virus
          ls -latr /etc/cron* --- look at all conr shit, compare to linops to find sussy stuff
            ls -latr /var/spool/crontab    maybe
            ls -latr /var/spool/at         maybe
          all that shit fro anti-virus will let you find it

/tmp
current user home, any homes you can access
      find / -type d -name ".*" 2>/dev/null  --- all hidden dirs

/etc/rsyslog.conf --- default rsyslog config file
/etc/rsyslog.d/       to see more files with logging rules
      50-default.conf
grep -v "#" /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf to get rid of comments and things not being logged
anything not going to /var/log, it is abnormal, so look at it
cat /etc/cron.d/popularity-contest
crontab.guru website to decipher cron stuff
weird crons are strange as well, look for flag form
sudo tail -n20 /var/log/auth.log --- root and priv user logs
tcpdump --- don't ask baout it, use your resources
netcat needs +x to run
any encoding is base64, use cyberchef
scp over socket     scp -o "ControlPath=/tmp/<>" placeholder:/home/student/not_real.txt .           download
